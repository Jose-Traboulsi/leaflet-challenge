| Earthquake Map |

This project visualizes earthquake data on an interactive map using JavaScript, Leaflet and D3.js.Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker, with the radius proportional to its magnitude and the color indicating its depth. Additionally, the map includes a legend indicating the depth color scale. We use HTML for the structure of the web page and CSS for styling (incluing for the legend). We also use OpenSreetMap tiles to display the interactive map.


| Features |

Display earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake Catalog.
Circle markers with radius proportional to earthquake magnitude.
Color-coded markers based on earthquake depth.
Legend indicating depth color scale.


| Usage |

The map is centered on New York City by default but with enough zoom out to view the entire map, and then displays earthquake data for the past week.
Note that I used hexadecimal color codes in this assignment.
You can reference the color legend to get an idea of the depth of each earthquake, and get a sense of relative magnitude by comparing the radius of each circle.
You can click on each registered earthquake to see additional information, such as location and magnitude.


| Dependencies |

Leaflet
D3.js
OpenStreetMap


| Notes |

I relied on course materials to produce the code and used AI for assistance with incorporating CSS formatting for the legend.
